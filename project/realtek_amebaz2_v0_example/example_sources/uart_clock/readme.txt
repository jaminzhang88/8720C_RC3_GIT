Example Description

This example describes how to use UART TX to simulate clock source

Required Components:
    Oscilloscope

Connect to PC
    1, Connect Ground: connect to GND of the oscilloscope
    2, Use UART1
        1), GPIOA_2 as UART1_RX connect NOTHING
        2), GPIOA_3 as UART1_TX connect to probe of the oscilloscope

This example shows:
    Clock signal output from UART1_TX to the oscilloscope
