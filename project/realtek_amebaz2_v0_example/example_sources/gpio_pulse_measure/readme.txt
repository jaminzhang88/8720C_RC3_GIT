Example Description

This example describes how to use GPIO read/write mbed api to generate a pulse and to measure the pulse width.

Requirement Components:
    a wire

Pin name PA_19 and PA_20 map to GPIOA_19 and GPIOA_20:
    1, PA_19 as the interrupt GPIO pin with no pull (High-Z).
    2, PA_20 as output to generate a pulse.
    3, Use a wire to connect PA_19 and PA_20

In this example, the UART console will print out the measured width (in us) of the pulse which generated by the interrupt GPIO pin.
